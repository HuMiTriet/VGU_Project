With this project, we had our ups and downs. We learned a lot about team work and trusting each other with the tasks we have been given. If someone struggled and was stuck on a task, there was always someone from the group to speak to/ask for help. This way we grew as a team and had a lot of fun as well working on our project. 

Each and everyone in our group was working hard and faced their own challenges on their way but we all persisted and we are proud of what we have accomplished in this short amount of time.  

We learned a lot of practical things not only in terms of Java and it's functionalities, but also expanded our knowledge on databases, creating GUIs, email API, network connection, understanding the Calendar and time and what can be done with it et cetera. 

Everything we have learned will be of great usage in our future endeavors and we have learned that you have to be adaptive and inventive facing difficulties and changes. 

Never give up and stay persistent, you will eventually overcome your problems and struggles.
