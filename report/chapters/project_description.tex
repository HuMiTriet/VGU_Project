This project was created to ease the planning and management of the time spent on activities. It aims to 
increase efficiency and productivity for it's user. Events are visually presented on a live calendar model and 
highlighted based on selected priority, making it faster for the user to distinguish important ones and their 
correlation to others. The data is stored both in a local and in a remote database, so users can access their 
schedule from any PC and even without a internet connection. Events include information about their name, 
description, date, duration, location and participants. Participants added to an event will also receive 
e-mail notifications when changes were made to the event. Admins can use the software to access or delete user
information about e-mail. Admins are able to change the names and e-mails of users.

In addition there is also an offline mode which allows the user to continue working on the database if there is no 
internet connection.
