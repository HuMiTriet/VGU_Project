        \section{Abstract} 
            Real As-stated, a website of Berlin team, offers a real estate trading service.
            Our primary goal is to incorporate blockchain technology into the real estate business model rather than the traditional model.
            By using blockchain technology in general and Hyperledger Faric in particular, we archive the high transaction trading speed, data security and some special features compared to old-fashion model such as fractional trading, membership service.
            Furthermore, we successfully launched our new cryptocurrency, Curry Wurst (CW), to support blockchain transactions.
            The front-end is the website written in React Native and Typescript programming language.
            In the back-end, we use Hyperledger Fabric to implement the core bussiness logic and Typescript to construct API routes to call functions from chaincode.
