        \section{Abstract} 
            Real As-stated, a website of Berlin team, offers a real estate trading service.
            Our primary goal is to incorporate blockchain technology into the real estate business model rather than the traditional model.
            By using blockchain technology in general and Hyperledger Faric in particular, we archive the high transaction trading speed, data security and some special features compared to old-fashion model such as fractional trading, membership service.
            Furthermore, we successfully launched our new cryptocurrency, Curry Wurst (CW), to support blockchain transactions.
            The front-end is the website written in React Native and Typescript programming language.
            In the back-end, we use Hyperledger Fabric to implement the core bussiness logic and Typescript to construct API routes to call functions from chaincode.
        \section{Introduction}
        Real estate is nowadyas the largest asset class in the world. 
        Property ownership has traditionally been governed by written rules and regulations established by a judge or court.
        This necessitates a significant amount of paperwork and takes a significant amount of time to complete all the procedure.
        As a result of the heavy reliance on paper documents, the structure is extremely vulnerable to loss, fraud, and mismanagement.
        However, blockchain technology has the potential to solve almost all of the problems that the current real estate model is experiencing. \\
        Because a blockchain transaction is verified by a network of computers, it is extremely secure. 
        Blockchain transactions are transparent and unchangeable since all the nodes have the ledger. 
        As a result, they are ideal for real estate transactions, which are frequently complex and involve numerous parties. 
        Because all parties can see the status of the transaction at all times with blockchain, there is no room for error or fraud. 
        Transactions on the blockchain are also quick and efficient. 
        They can be completed in fractions of seconds as opposed to weeks or even months for traditional real estate transactions.
